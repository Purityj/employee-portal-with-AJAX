# employee-portal-with-AJAX
This repository demonstrates the implementation of an Employee Portal using different AJAX techniques: Vanilla JavaScript (using XMLHttpRequest), the Fetch API, and Axios. The purpose of this project is to explore and compare these techniques in terms of ease of use, functionality, and flexibility in handling asynchronous HTTP requests in a web application.

Features

    List Employees: Display all employees fetched from a mock backend server.
    Add Employee: Allows the user to add a new employee to the database.
    Update Employee: Enables updating existing employee details.
    Delete Employee: Provides the option to remove an employee from the database.

Technologies Used

    Express.js: Serves as the backend to manage employee data.
    Node.js: Runtime environment for the backend.
    Axios/Fetch API/XMLHttpRequest: Used for making HTTP requests in different implementations.
    Bootstrap: For styling and modal implementations.
    CORS: Enabled on the server to handle cross-origin requests.
